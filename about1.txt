Problem Statement:

The task is to perform digit classification on the Kannada MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits in the Kannada script. The dataset contains 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing, with each image being of size 28x28 pixels. The goal is to classify these images into one of the 10 classes, representing the digits from 0 to 9.
Steps Involved:

    Extract the Dataset: Obtain the Kannada MNIST dataset from a source like Kaggle or an online repository. The dataset contains image files in a compressed format like npz.

    Preprocessing - PCA: Before applying classification models, perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This step is essential for reducing computational complexity and noise in the data.

    Model Selection: Apply various classification models to the PCA-transformed data. The models selected for this task include Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

    Evaluation Metrics: For each model, compute several evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC curve. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the models and help in comparing them.

    Experimentation: Repeat the experiment with different numbers of principal components (e.g., 10, 15, 20, 25, 30). This step helps in understanding how the number of principal components affects the performance of the classification models.

Purpose:

The purpose of this exercise is to develop and evaluate machine learning models for digit classification using the Kannada MNIST dataset. By performing PCA and experimenting with different numbers of principal components, we aim to understand the impact of dimensionality reduction on model performance. Additionally, evaluating multiple classification algorithms allows us to identify the most suitable model for this task.

Overall, this process enables us to gain insights into the classification of Kannada digits and provides a framework for tackling similar classification problems in the future.
